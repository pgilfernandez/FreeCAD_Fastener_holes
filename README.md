# FreeCAD_Fastener_holes
This macro creates shapes to act as holes when cut to other shapes. It makes easy and fast the creation and tweaking of all needed parts. It may be very useful when designing parts for 3D printing and others.

## Example

Base part:

![example1](/../media/fastener_holes_1.jpeg?raw=true "example 1")

Creating holes with the macro by preselecting faces, edges and points to easily place them:

![example2](/../media/fastener_holes_2.jpeg?raw=true "example 2")

Selecting the holes and creating a boolean operation into the base part:

![example3](/../media/fastener_holes_3.jpeg?raw=true "example 3")

Finally, using [Fasteners workbench](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Fasteners_Workbench) you can easily add the fasteners themselves:

![example4](/../media/fastener_holes_4.jpeg?raw=true "example 4")
